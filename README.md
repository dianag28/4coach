This project explores the growing number of disappearances in the United States, particularly for individuals affected by the Trump administration's policies. 
Using a publicly available dataset from Tableau, I conducted a time series analysis to uncover patterns and assess trends over time.

By preprocessing the dataset, visualizing historical trends, and applying ARIMA forecasting, this analysis aims to provide insights into how disappearance rates 
have fluctuated and what future trends may look like.
